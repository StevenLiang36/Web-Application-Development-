                        I am now major in Artificial Intelligence, which is a hot major nowadays. Why did I choose this major? 
                        My reason is quite simlpe. Firstly, I am interested in the major and I want to know more about it. 
                        Secondly, as the rapid development of the high-tech, AI have spilled into more and more fields in the modern society. 
                        Learning AI can make me more competitive when finding jobs. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="aText">
                        It is not easy to study AI. There are several programming languages that I need to handle, such as python, java, C++ and so on. 
                        Only mastering these languages can you do well in the major. 
                        Except programming language, other skills like web development, usage of WebGL are also need to be handled.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aText">
                        In all, my major is challenging but interesting. I will do my best learning it and make contribution in the field.
                    </p>

                    <p class="aText">I usually spend my leisure time playing football, as football is my favorite sport.
                         Right now I am playing in the football team in my institute with the role of right back. </p>
                    <p class="textTitle2">The king of right sideline!</p>
                    <p class="aText">As a right back, I think I am more talented in defense, but if my teammate need me to attack,
                         I can also run across the whole field to assist or score. In short, I am the king of right sideline!</p>
                    <p class="textTitle2"> Why?</p>
                    <p class="aText">Why do I like playing football? There are several reason.</br>
                        - The thrill of scoring goals </br>
                        - Great joy of teamwork </br>
                        - The way I build my body and relax </br>
                        - Inspiration from my idol: Lionel Messi</p>

                    <p class="aText">
                        I am a big fan of the outer space.  When I was young, I had a dream of being an astronaut as I had the passion of exploring the unknown.
                        As I grow up, reasons like shortsightedness prevent me from becoming an astronaut, so my dream changed to working in the aerospace field in the future. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="aText">
                        The reason why I become a outer space lover is that I keen on watching science fiction movie, especially the movie that about the space. 
                        My favorite movie is <em>Interstellar</em> by Nolan. it tells the story about human explore the space to find the way to survive. 
                        Its brilliant story line and special effects really make this film an indubitable classic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="textTitle2">Mechanical engineering</p>
                    <p class="aText">Science fiction movie also makes me fall in love in mechanical engineering. The world-famous movie, <em>Iron Man</em>, shows the charm of machinery.
                         The most impressive iron man armor is Mark 5, which can be transformed into a small case. How can it transform? Can I create my own armor like this? 
                         I can't help asking these questions when I first saw the armor, which drives me to know more mechanical engineering.
